  abstract = "All living organisms require a variety of essential elements for
              their basic biological functions. While the homeostasis of
              nutrients is highly intertwined, the molecular and genetic
              mechanisms of these dependencies remain poorly understood. Here,
              we report a discovery of a molecular pathway that controls
              phosphate (Pi) accumulation in plants under Zn deficiency. Using
              genome-wide association studies, we first identified allelic
              variation of the () gene as the key determinant of shoot Pi
              accumulation under Zn deficiency. We then show that regulatory
              variation at the LPCAT1 locus contributes significantly to this
              natural variation and we further demonstrate that the regulation
              of expression involves bZIP23 TF, for which we identified a new
              binding site sequence. Finally, we show that in Zn deficient
              conditions loss of function of increases the phospholipid
              Lyso-PhosphatidylCholine/PhosphatidylCholine ratio, the
              expression of the Pi transporter PHT1;1, and that this leads to
              shoot Pi accumulation.",

              spectrometry has been employed to profile membrane lipid
              molecular species in Arabidopsis undergoing cold and freezing
              stresses. Freezing at a sublethal temperature induced a decline
              in many molecular species of phosphatidylcholine (PC),
              phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) but
              induced an increase in phosphatidic acid (PA) and
              lysophospholipids. To probe the metabolic steps generating these
              changes, lipids ofArabidopsis deficient in the most abundant
              phospholipase D, PLD$\alpha$, were analyzed. The PC content
              dropped only half as much, and PA levels rose only half as high
              in the PLD$\alpha$-deficient plants as in wild-type plants. In
              contrast, neither PE nor PG levels decreased significantly more
              in wild-type plants than in PLD$\alpha$-deficient plants. These
              data suggest that PC, rather than PE and PG, is the majorin vivo
              substrate of PLD$\alpha$. The action of PLD$\alpha$ during
              freezing is of special interest because Arabidopsis plants that
              are deficient in PLD$\alpha$ have improved tolerance to freezing.
              The greater loss of PC and increase in PA in wild-type plants as
              compared with PLD$\alpha$-deficient plants may be responsible for
              destabilizing membrane bilayer structure, resulting in a greater

              jasmonic acid (JA) remains the best understood in terms of its
              biosynthesis, function and signaling. Much like their eicosanoid
              analogues in mammalian system, evidence is growing for the role
              of the other oxylipins in diverse physiological processes. JA
              serves as the model plant oxylipin species and regulates defense
              and development. For several decades, the biology of JA has been
              characterized in a few dicot species, yet the function of JA in
              monocots has only recently begun to be elucidated. In this work,
              the synthesis and function of JA in maize is presented from the
              perspective of oxylipin biology. The maize genes responsible for
              catalyzing the reactions in the JA biosynthesis are clarified and

              defense against insect herbivory, pathogens and its role in
              growth and development are highlighted. Additionally, a list of
